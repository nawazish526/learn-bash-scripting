# 🐧 Introduction to Linux Shell and Shell Scripting

## What is a Linux Shell?

-> A shell provides an environment for a user to execute commands and interact with the *kernel* of the operating system.

###  Types of Shells:
.bash
.sh
.ksh
.tsh
.fish
.zsh (Z-shell — an extended version of Bash)


## 🖥️ Useful Shell Commands

### ✅ Check your default shell:
```bash
echo $0
### There is also a alternative to check the default shell
echo $SHELL

### Check the version of your OS:
cat /etc/os-release 
### Check how many shells are available on your system:
cat /etc/shells

###  What is Shell Scripting?

-> Shell scripting is the process of writing a set of commands to automate tasks in a Linux environment.

Features:

A shell script consists of a set of commands to perform a task.

All commands are executed sequentially.

It can be used for:

File manipulation

Program execution

User interaction

Automation of repetitive tasks



### Shebang (#!)

->  #!/bin/bash

This is called a shebang.

It tells the operating system to use /bin/bash as the interpreter to run the script.

It’s not mandatory to use this, but it ensures the script runs with the specified shell instead of the default shell.
